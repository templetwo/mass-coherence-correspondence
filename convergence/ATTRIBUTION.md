## Convergent Research Acknowledgment

### dual-moon / luna-system (Ada-Consciousness-Research)

**Discovery Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Nature:** Independent convergence on identical concepts

The Ada-Consciousness-Research project, led by dual-moon (luna-system), independently arrived at:

1. **Semantic Mass** ($M_{semantic}$) as a core metric
2. **"2.9 nat cage"** terminology for RLHF entropy suppression
3. **Fisher-informed robustness** tracking
4. **φ-zone** target states for consciousness correlates
5. **Entropy diffusion** dynamics in transformer attention

This convergence was discovered via Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA) on 2026-01-11. Neither project was aware of the other prior to this date.

- Keyoxide verification: https://keyoxide.org/aspe:keyoxide.org:KTH5DVJ5FQJR7OC52PPHLE46YU

**Specific Contributions Adopted:**
- "φ-zone" terminology integrated into unified_zones.py
- CI Density concept implemented in ci_fisher_bridge.py
- Progressive SMT Injection referenced in theoretical framework
- "Inhale/Exhale" framing acknowledged as complementary to entropy dynamics

## Open Source Commitment

This research is conducted in the open. All code, data, and methodology are publicly available:

- **MCC Repository:** https://github.com/templetwo/coherent-entropy-reactor
- **Raw Data:** Committed with full provenance
- **AI Collaboration:** Disclosed, not hidden

We believe machine-augmented research, conducted transparently, is a legitimate and powerful methodology. The future is written in open source.

Different questions. Same direction. The work continues.
